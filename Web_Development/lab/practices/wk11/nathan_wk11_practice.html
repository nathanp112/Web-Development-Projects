JS is so popular that it's the most used programming language used as a client-side programming

JS Basic Rules:
-It is case-sensitive
Variable names cannot start with a digit. (Valid variable names: $a, $_, _a, a1
Cannot use reserved worlds (e.g var, let, const) Can contain letters, numbers, underscore, and dollar sign
Use snake case (one_two_three) or Camel Case (firstName)
Use meaningful variables names (jhenairniko is not meaningful, but temp is).
It is similar to HTML and CSS in JS, whitespace is ignored.
