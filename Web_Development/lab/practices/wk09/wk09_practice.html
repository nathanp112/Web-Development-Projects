<!--tables are tabular data formed by rows and columns.
    A table is made up of rows using tr tag
    You have a table made up of rows and within that you have data cells using td tag.
    There is no such thing as a column cell
    You get columns by adding rows and data that stack up to form columns
    note: you must have equal number of data cells within each row.
    colspan: span columns
    rowspan: spans rows

    vertical cell alignment: can be left, centre or right
    thread tag is for table header (optional, good to have)
    tr tag is within tbody tag (optional, good to have)
    tfoot is for table footer (optional, good to have)
    cell padding: refers to cushion around cells
    cell spacing: refers to space between cells (border doesn't get thicker)
    cell width and height can be changed as well.
    when height is given to a cell, all cells in the row will adhere to that height.
    same with width of cell.
